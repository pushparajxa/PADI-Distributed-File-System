The goal of this project is to design and implement PADI-FS, a distributed system to manage
 sets of files. Users can develop applications that access the PADI-FS to keep their files repli-
 cated and highly available. The relevant operations on files are limited to open, create, read,
 write, close and delete.
 This distributed store is inspired by, and a simplification of, real systems such as Google File
 System, or HDFS. The contents of the files are backed by a number of data servers that provide
 their storage space, and are coordinated by the clients.

 Programmed in C#
